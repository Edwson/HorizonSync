HorizonSync
Turn time zones into your competitive advantage with intelligent global team coordination.

Overview
HorizonSync is a smart global team coordination tool that transforms timezone challenges into workflow opportunities. Instead of just showing world clocks, it uses AI to suggest optimal team structures for 24-hour productivity cycles, seamless handoffs, and strategic hiring decisions.
Key Innovation: Turn "timezone problems" into "workflow solutions" through intelligent analysis and recommendations.

Quick Start
Prerequisites

Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
Web server with PHP 7.4+ (for AI features)
Optional: Gemini API key for AI recommendations

Installation

Clone the repository

bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/horizonsync.git
cd horizonsync

Set up the web server

bash# Using PHP built-in server (development)
php -S localhost:8000

# Or configure your preferred web server to serve the files

Configure AI features (optional)

bash# Copy and edit the PHP configuration
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

Open in browser

http://localhost:8000
That's it! HorizonSync works entirely in the browser with local data storage.

Get specific timezone and hiring suggestions
Implement recommended team structure



Example AI Interactions
User: "We need 24-hour development coverage"
AI: "Your current coverage is 16 hours. Consider hiring in Central Europe (GMT+1) 
     for 2-hour overlap with your Taipei team and 4-hour overlap with potential 
     US East Coast expansion."

User: "Where should I hire my next QA engineer?"
AI: "Based on your current Taipei development team (7:00-16:00), London 
     (9:00-17:00) would create a perfect handoff window at 15:00-16:00 Taipei time."
